# Here are the interview questions

LECTURE 1

1. Difference between Library and Framework
- We control the flow of a library while there is fixed flow of a framework and we have to go with it.
- Angular is a framework - it has a fixed knowledge where to make file... 
- React is a library - we can make any file anywhere...

2. Two type of file might be there - App.tsx and App.jsx . What is the difference ?
- This App.tsx - it is a typescript file where tsx stands for typescript xml
- This App.jsx - it is a javascript file where jsx stands for javascript xml

3. Which file loads first ?
- index.html -> main.jsx -> App.jsx and so on..

4. Why we write the first element of the function in react a capital letter ?
- Because in React we can write the html code also, so to make the software identify the difference between the react code and the html we use it capital as the code of html or every function in html is in small letter.
